Templates for an open-source Phishing Toolkit
Some very basic configurations and templates to provide clean layouts usable in [GoPhish](https://github.com/gophish/gophish), an open-source phishing toolkit. These layouts provided will also work with any other phising service as well, though they have only been tested in GoPhish.

Installing the files is easy. Download the GoPhish client and log in at `https://127.0.0.1:3333/` with the standard credentials visible in the command line. There, the various templates and landing pages can be configured with my html configurations.

## Disclaimer
The files in this repository were created and modified by me,  for my own personal use and come with no guarantee to work for you. I provide these files "as-is" and offer no support whatsoever to get them working. A lot of these files use terrible formatted and layered tables, anyone working with email and newsletter designs knows how painful they can be, and how worse it is to reverse-engineer those.
